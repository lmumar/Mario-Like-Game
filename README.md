# Mario game in C++

Here is my first C++ game that I found in my archives and I decided to share it with all game fans passionate about programming. It is a 2D platformer game using SDL and Fmod libraries.

## Features

- Edition mode : possibility to edit your own levels
- Light media player
- Possibility to play with Joystick or Keyboard
- and it is Mario :heart_eyes:
